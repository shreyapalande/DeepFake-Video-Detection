# DeepFake-Video-Detection

Deepfake video detection is essential to prevent the spread of misinformation and protect individuals from identity theft and reputational damage. It also helps maintain the integrity of digital content in media, legal, and social contexts. 
The proposed deepfake video detection is essential to prevent the spread of misinformation and protect individuals from identity theft and reputational damage. It also helps maintain the integrity of digital content in media, legal, and social contexts. 

Using ResNext and LSTM model for deepfake detection and LIME to enhance the interpretability of our model's predictions. The model is trainied on custom dataset collected from college students.
